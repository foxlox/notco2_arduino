Project borns in 2011 by a personal need, I'm a mathematical, then I can't leave an independent variable to change my life for a sport.
This independent variable is Carbon Dioxide, CO2. Then I decided to begin a new project to analyze my breathe underwater.

Till today, me and other many peoples are using it with satisfaction by over 6 years.
The sensor is working good for an average life of 5 years.

I received a lot of offers for my project, but I wish to share this with other peoples who want to hack.

Please do not criticize the source code, I'm really (but really!) much professional and tidier
than you would consider me looking at it. It was born to hack, and then when it was working 100% I left it as it is.

It bores me to refine it and I'll not do it just now
that I want to share it ;-)
Now it's your time to refine it, but remember: it really works very well!!!

Documents:

a. layout of PCB and project to build it

b. required hardware components

c. source code HUD (never optimized, discreetly legible, absolutely improvable...)

d. source code Wrist Console (also fot it never optimized, discreetly legible, absolutely improvable...)

e. all DGWs to build your own enclosures with a 3d lathe machine

f. some pics


About CO2 Sensor: I cannot include device's interface specification without owner authorization, but you could try to ask
them: Dynament Ltd - www.dynament.com

  The sensor doesn't suffer with moisture, it's important to stay face down in the loop, and to be dry after diving.
				  

Please, read ALL documents in each folder.

It works perfectly but you must build it perfectly too.
